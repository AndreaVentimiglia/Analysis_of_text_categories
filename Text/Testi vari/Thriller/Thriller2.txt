oes in this
          one. And after William Cecil, his
          hunch-backed son will take his
          place...
                 (careful)
          That is why we must do everything in
          our power to ensure that the right man
          succeeds her.
                 (beat)
          A man deserving of the Tudor crown.

Southampton stiffens at that last phrase.

                       ESSEX (CONT'D)
          I ask you for the support of you and
          your men, Henry.... if it comes to a
          fight.

     Southampton looks at Essex hard.

                             SOUTHAMPTON
                You know you need not ask. I stand
                with you, as I always have.

     Essex smiles at him warmly. They both HEAR something
     shuffle behind them. They turn, and see:

     WHERE OXFORD WAS STANDING

     Nothing.   He is gone.

     BACK TO SOUTHAMPTON AND ESSEX

     They exchange a slightly worried look.

                                                         CUT TO:


20   EXT. ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                                         20

     Moments later, Oxford and Southampton are exiting the
     elaborate building that serves as Essex's London
     residence.

                             OXFORD
                Essex played rather poorly, didn't he?

     Southampton just nods, distracted.   Oxford reaches out
     to him, and touches his shoulder.

                             OXFORD (CONT'D)
                       (warning)
                Henry... The Cecils brook no rivals.

     Southampton pauses, confused for an instant, then--

                             SOUTHAMPTON
                       (re: his discussion with
                        Essex)
                You heard?

     Oxford nods.

                             SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
                Always concerned for me, aren't you
                Edward?

     They keep walking towards Southampton's men.

                             SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
                And what would you have me do?


                                                                   19

                       OXFORD
          I would have you deny him.

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          The son of the Queen?

                       OXFORD
          That is rumor only, Henry--

They stop. Southampton makes sure that his men are out
of earshot.

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          Rumor? My god, all you have to do is
          look at Essex to see the Queen's
          reflection. Everyone thinks he's her
          son, everyone! And I for one would
          rather bow to a Tudor, bastard though
          he may be, than a Scotsman!

                        OXFORD
          I desire nothing more than to see the
          next king be the rightful king. But
          what Essex contemplates will surely
          lead to Civil War.
                 (beat)
          No. If this is to be done, it must be
